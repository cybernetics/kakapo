## Acronyms and Initialisms

| Term | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| GUID | [Globally Unique Identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) are used primarily to represent users. |

## General Information

The Kakapo server at it's core is really just an online storage system with some basic user management and sharing features. Users are identified by GUIDs. Users may upload "items" to be shared with other users. These items are comprised of two segments of encrypted data: a header and content.

The encrypted header is intended to be a preview of the item and may contain a small amount of data while the content is intended to contain more data. For example, if a user shared a photo, the header could contain a thumbnail while the content could contain the full-resolution photo. As a second example, if a user shared a URL and/or a simple text-based message, the header could contain the URL and/or message, and the content could be empty.

How the encrypted data is structured within these two containers is at the client's discretion. There are limits set by the Kakapo server on the size of each of these containers. These limits can be fetched from the server.

The protocol is stateless and authentication occurs for every request, so authentication information must be provided with each request that requires it. Any endpoint that requires the "Kakapo-ID" and "Kakapo-API-Key" headers is one that requires authentication.

In addition to some standard HTTP codes, there are some custom HTTP codes in use. These are HTTP 442 (quota exceeded), 443 (insufficient key length), and 444 (no prekeys available).

## Hex strings

In many cases keys, salts, and nonces are represented as strings. These are typically produced via libsodium's to\_hex() call and may be converted back to a binary representation using libsodium's to\_bin() call.

## Crypto

Kakapo makes use of Libsodium (well, more specifically, the LazySodium Java bindings for Libsodium.

You may see the LibSodiumCrypto class in the kakapo repository for details regarding the specific libsodium calls that are used, but a bit of an explanation regarding the key agreement mechanism is warranted here.

### Key agreement mechanism

As the communication in Kakapo is asynchronous, we need a way to allow key agreement to happen with the recipient(s) offline. We do this through "prekeys" (thank you, Moxie, for explaining this in a way I can understand).

Every user, when connected to the Kakapo server, must generate and upload a set of prekeys. When someone wants to share something with one or more users, they must get prekeys for those users from the server. Using those prekeys, and their own private key that they generate, they generate shared secrets with each recipient.

The client then must generate a group key that will be used to encrypt the shared item, and encrypt that group key with each shared secret for each recipient.

The public key exchange key, prekey ID, encrypted group key, and encrypted content is then sent off to each recipient, who must then use the secret half of the prekey that they have to decrypt the group key and then use the group key to decrypt the message.

## Rate limiting

All endpoints are rate-limited. Rate-limiting uses the [token-bucket algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).

Rate limiting is done by both source IP address and user GUID (where possible).  The following table contains the currently-configured values for rate limiting.

| Method | Path | Token count | Refill rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | /api/v1/account/create | 10 | 1/day |
| GET | /api/v1/item/headers | 600 | 10/min |
| | all others | 60 | 1/min |

As a brief explanation, with the create account endpoint: each IP address can make 10 requests to this endpoint at which point the bucket is empty and further requests from the IP address will be denied. Every day, one token is added to the bucket, which means that a further request can be made each day. If three days go by without any account creation requests from the IP address, three requests will go through successfully before further requests are rejected.

With all other endpoints, only the numbers change. The buckets for "all others" initially contain 60 tokens and are refilled at a rate of 1 per minute, with a maximum of 60.

Remember that these are per-IP address and per-user GUID. In the cases where the URL contains a path parameter, they are also per-URL.

The primary reason for rate-limiting is to prevent abuse of the Kakapo network. The primary point of entry for abuse is account creation, which is why that endpoint is so severely restricted. The goal is to balance the need for legitimate users to create accounts with the desire to prevent malicious users from creating vast quanitities of accounts.

These limits will be adjusted as necessary.

## User-related endpoints

### Create a new user account

This call is used to create a new user account. A public key must be provided and the server will generate and return a new GUID and API Key for the user. In any subsequent call that requires authentication, this combination of GUID and API Key must be provided.

The signing public key must be 32 bytes long.

**POST /api/v1/account**

Request Body:

```json
{
	"signingPublicKey" : "<Hex string representation of public key>"

```

Response Body:

```json

	"apiKey" : "<API Key for the new account>"
}
```

| 404 | Not found; the specified item was either not found or the user does not own the item.
| 429 | Too many requests; there have been too many requests of this type from the IP address and/or user. |

### List item headers

Fetch a list of item headers that are visible to a specific user. The items are fetched in reverse chronological order, starting with the first item with an ID less than the "count" request parameter.

The "parent" and "id" values are optional. If the "parent" value is specified, only items with the specified parent item ID are fetched. If the "id" value is specified only that single item is fetched. If both are specified, the "parent" value is ignored. 

If the "parent" value is not specified, only "parentless" items are fetched.

A note regarding blacklisted users: When the "parent" (parent item id) value is provided, items from blacklisted users will be included in the response. If the "parent" value is not provided, items from blacklisted users will not be included in the response. The reason for this is that when fetching the children of a specified parent, the item from the blacklisted author may be in the middle of a response tree and it is important for the client to have the complete tree of responses for presentation purposes.

**GET /api/v1/item/headers**

Request Headers:

- **Kakapo-ID**: The user's GUID, for authentication.
- **Kakapo-API-Key**: the user's API Key, for authentication.

Request Parameters:

- **count**: The number of item headers to fetch, within the range 1-20.
- **last**: The item ID to start fetching headers after
- **parent**: If specified, only fetch items that are children of this item ID (optional)
- **id**: A specific item ID to fetch (optional)

Response Body:

```

	"shareItems" : [
		{
			"remoteId" : <the item ID>
			"ownerGuid" : "<the GUID of the owner/author of the item>"
			"parentRemoteId" : <the parent ID of this item (may be null)>
			"markedAsDeleted" : true|false (true if the item has been marked as deleted, false if not),
			"blacklisted" : true|false (true if the item is owned by a blacklisted author, false if not),
			"itemTimestamp" : <item timestamp in GMT (in ms from the epoch (midnight, January 1, 1970))>
			"encryptedHeader" : "<Hex string representation of the encrypted header data>",
			"headerNonce" : "<Hex string representation of the nonce used to encrypt the header>",

### Fetch recipients for an item

Fetch the list of recipients for a given item. This may be useful if, for example, someone is posting a follow-up to an item, as the follow-up should probably be visible to all the users that the original item was visible to.

Request Body:

```
